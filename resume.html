Relevant Courses: Aeronautics, Dynamics of Flight Vehicles, Turbulence and Turbulent Flows, Intermediate Fluid Dynamics with CFD, Propulsion of Aircraft and Rockets, Finite Element Analysis, Mechatronics, Design for Manufacturing, Dimensioning and Tolerancing


EXPERIENCE
Teaching Assistant, Ithaca, NY, ANSYS Simulation	January - May 2024
Aided students in office hours by answering questions about FEA and CFD simulations in ANSYS 
Graded assignments for the CFD and FEA classes


GE Aerospace, Evendale, OH, Fan and Compressor Aerodynamics Intern	June - August 2023
Completed course on turbomachinery CFD with emphasis on turbulence modeling, numerics, and meshing.
Implemented two novel data reduction methods in Python and Fortran 77.
Performed assessment of test hardware using NX to ensure compatibility with future test configurations.
Performed quality assessments of as-manufactured hardware for test.


New England Wire Technologies, Lisbon, NH, Process Engineer Intern	June - July 2022 
Analyzed CFD data for a thermoplastic extruder that makes custom multi-lumen catheters to determine if the extrusions would meet customer specifications.
Modified the extrusion tooling through 10 design iterations using Inventor to improve flow distribution.
Researched the yield strengths and elastic moduli of three different extruded thermoplastics at high temperatures, conducted tensile tests, and analyzed experimental yield stress to assess the viability of coreless extrusion.
Designed two fixtures for non-destructive tensile testing of 10 samples ranging from 0.1 to 0.3 in diameter to validate the strength of the catheter tip attachment.
Researched possible materials to replace the fiberglass wrap on extruder heads to keep workers safe from burns. Designed a ceramic piece assembly in CAD to fit over and attach to the extruder head to work as a heat guard.


Combat Robotics at Cornell, Cornell University, Vice Subteam Lead	October 2021 -  May 2023
Collaborated with 7 mechanical engineers to design and build a low kinetic energy 12 lb combat robot focused on creative design, strategy, and repairability to compete in the Norwalk Havoc Robot League.
Worked with the Subteam Lead to oversee progress and assign tasks to the 6 other subteam members.
Modeled designs of the weapon subassembly in Fusion 360, taking weight and robustness into consideration.
Manufactured robot components on a mill and assembled a competition ready robot.
Created an intensive 6 week training program involving designing a 3 lb robot for the 16 new team members from all 4 subteams before they become full members in the spring. 
Taught 5 interactive workshops on valuable engineering skills such as CAD, part drawings, part speccing, sketching, ideation, and manufacturing.
