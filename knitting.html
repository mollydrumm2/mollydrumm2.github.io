                The Acadia National Park pattern from "Knitting the National Parks." Made for my friend Alex's birthday before I visited her in Maine. Lovely fun birch tree colorwork.

                Yet another "Knitting the National Parks" pattern, this one is for Arches National Park, my sister's favorite. I made this for my sister's birthday, my first time doing cables, and with some glow in the dark yarn stars on top. Sadly I never took a good photo of it so here we have it modeled by Ernie the dog.

                Another great pattern from "Knitting the National Parks." I made this on the plane before I visited Rory for her birthday and did the whole thing in a 9 hr straight knitting spree.

                I made this hat for my mom for the holidays. She picked this pattern out of a great book I got called "Knitting the National Parks" by Nancy Bates. This one was very fun and quick to make.

            <p>
                I made this sweater for my sister Sammy after she sent me this lovely pattern from <a href="http://sweaterscapes.com" target="_blank">sweaterscapes.com</a>. The pattern is based on Nubble Lighthouse in York Beach, Maine, which is behind me in the photo. The intarsia colorwork was very hard and this took me over 100 hrs. Sammy should be very grateful. Also this time I checked gauge and it fits yay!

            <h2>soft tire | 2022</h2>
            <p>
                After the Formula 1 season ended in 2022 I was bored so I knit myself this plush soft tire (get it? its soft). I made the colorwork pattern myself using a very nice website called <a href="http://stitchfiddle.com" target="_blank">stitchfiddle.com</a>. I was not prepared for how hard intarsia is when I made this but I am very pleased with the result.

            <p>
                Until I made the nubble sweater I never once paid attention to gauge before I started a project, which is really bad because I knit really big. I made this hat for myself using the "August Hat" pattern by Sarah Solomon on <a href="https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/august-hat-2" target="_blank">ravelry.com</a>, which is the best free colorwork hat pattern ever. Sadly the hat came out huge but luckily I gave it to my friend O'Leary who has lots of hair (as pictured).

            <h2>lampshade | 2021</h2>
            <p>
                For machine shop training at school we made these very ugly lamps out of aluminium using a mill for the base and lathe for the stem. I got a cool rainbow bulb for the lamp and decided to make a lampshade for it. This was my first and only time knitting lace (in worsted weight yarn eek) but I absolutely adore how this came out and how the light shows through it so I hope to make something like this again someday.

            <h2>cornell sweater | 2021</h2>
            <p>
                They sell sweaters like this at the Cornell store for over $100 but I thought I could make one for a lot cheaper. Sadly it came out way bigger than it was supposed to because I obviously did not check the gauge again, but I kinda like that its big and comfy. Certainly one of a kind.

    <div class="content-box">

        <div class="content-box-text">
            <h2>flame gloves | 2020</h2>
            <p>
                I had gloves with flames on them as a little kid from LL Bean and I really wanted another pair but they didn't make them for adults. Also I really wanted fingerless gloves. So I made this monstrosity mixing together 2 different free patterns I found online somewhere. This was my first time doing any colorwork, and I am shocked that these things haven't fallen apart yet. Also, obviously they're way too big because I never felt like checking gauge. But nonetheless I wear these whenever its cold and they're probably my favorite thing I ever knit.

            <h2>undertale sweater | 2016</h2>
            <p>
                 I was really obsessed with the game Undertale in freshman year of high school. I never actually played it though I just like watching walkthroughs. There's a character in it with a sweater like this so I wanted it really bad. This was my first ever sweater so there's a lot of issues but luckily it is not too big for me now because I made it for my little 15 year old self. After I made this I got sick of knitting and didn't come back to it until I was bored during the pandemic.

                 This was my first real project after I learned to knit. My mom made me make it for her using a pattern out of a book she got me called "Kids' Knitting" by Melanie Falick. It came out ok and making i-cords is super fun. My mom never wears it though because she says it's "too special."
